CHANGES
=======

0.4.1 (2013-11-28)
------------------

- bugfix: prevent generating bad buildout option key/value seperators. Generate
  `+=` instead of `+ =` used for e.g. buildout parts options. Otherwise it
  fails since buildout 2.0


0.4.0 (2013-11-24)
------------------

- feature: implemented a new argument `vars` in deployment template section. The
  new `vars` argument can get used for define a release template section. If 
  defined, the build process will apply all arguments from this section as they
  would be a a part of the project section. This allows to inherit a large
  amount of arguments in a project definition instead of define them in
  each project. This is usefull if you have a stage and many production variants
  and the instance uses config data like a database setup and you need to
  share them. For such a usecase you can simply define a stage and production
  section and define all shared arguments and use the right `vars` section in
  your product deployment setup. See the memcached sample in index.txt

  Note, this new product deployment template `vars` argument could be a problem
  for your existing setup if you use a vars argument with a value similar then
  a section name defined in your section template.


0.3.1 (2013-09-25)
------------------

- Improvement: added `default-package-version` command line option
  to avoid interactive questions on new packages


0.3.0 (2012-12-27)
------------------

- feature: added -i --independent-branches option. This option will force
  to check if the last release was made from the same branch we are
  releasing from. This is required if you develop a new software generation
  in a branch which is independent from the trunk. Previous version of
  keas.build where only able to handle branch releases as bug fix releases
  and didn't make sure that we don't mix trunk and branch releases. Now with
  the -i option we force that all released packages will be made or reused
  based on the current trunk or branch (-b trunk,branch)

- added more logging infos for find or skip next version which makes is simpler
  to see what's going on


0.2.2 (2011-08-29)
------------------

- Improvement: add `current-datetime`, `current-date`, `current-time` variables


0.2.1 (2011-04-07)
------------------

- Fix RawConfigParser usage, it destroys options values by making them
  all lowercase.


0.2.0 (2011-04-06)
------------------

- Bump versions to ZTK 1.1

- Improvement: add SVN repo infos to the project config file.
  Yah, I know this can be checked anytime, but adding this saves a lot of time.

- Improvement: add option ``hash-config-files``


0.1.8 (2010-05-11)
------------------

- Fix: Do NOT ``register`` with ``python setup.py``

- Fix: bump setuptools and zc.buildout versions

- Fix: 0.1.7 tar.gz was broken

0.1.7 (2010-04-26)
------------------

- BUGFIX: the dependent config file gathering killed the version pins
  in the master config file

- Improvement: PYPI-like simple index support when checking package versions

- Improvement: Check dependent configs, upload all to the server.

- Improvement: Add ``--force-version`` option.

- Improvement: Add version to svn log comment. That makes life easier (at least
  with TortoiseSVN)

- Improvement: Add ``--force-svnauth`` option.

- Improvement: Add ``--directory`` option to ``install``.

0.1.6 (2009-11-2)
------------------

- Improvement: When determining released versions of a branch, support
  branch names ending with .x, as in MyProject-0.3.x

0.1.5 (2009-10-16)
------------------

- Improvement: add username and password on install to the URL that buildout
  gets for the .cfg file
  Let's hope that buildout does not leave that password around.

- Improvement(?) or fix: remove twisted dependency that was used in deploy
  for SSH

- Improvement: removed dependency on lxml.  Now we just use pythons
  built-in xml library.

- Improvement: added ``buildout-upload-type`` option.
  See doc for further info

- Bug Fix: multiline template option values crashed on parsing

- Bug Fix: re did not like non-text parameters coming from BeautifulSoup

- Improvement: added the ``--timeout`` option to install

0.1.4 (2009-10-01)
------------------

- Bug Fix: installer script would crash when -u option was missing a
  trailing /

- Bug Fix: installer script would crash when no variants were found.

- Improvement: Building a package will no longer checkout the entire
  branch just to update the setup.py file with the new version
  number.  Instead only the top level directory is checked out.

- Bug Fix: project build script would crash when variant
  configuration was missing information required by its template. Now
  a helpful error message is printed and no files will be uploaded
  until all have been created successfully.

- Bug Fix: Typing Ctrl+c on the command line no longer causes a
  KeyboardInterrupt traceback to be spit out.

- Bug Fix: when running the installer, if the buildout command prompts
  the user for input, the installer will no longer eat up the prompt.

  error message.
